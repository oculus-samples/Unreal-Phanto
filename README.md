# Project Phanto - Presence Platform Reference App

![Phanto Banner](./Media/PhantoTitle.png 'Phanto')

# Project overview

Project Phanto is an Unreal reference app, showcasing the latest Presence Platform
features, highlighting scene mesh, Scene Model, and Scene API objects. It was developed using [the Meta fork of Unreal Engine 5.5](#meta-fork).

The
[scene mesh](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-scene-mesh/)
is a low-fidelity, high-coverage artifact which describes the boundary between
free and occupied space in a room. It is generated automatically during the
Space Setup experience, and available for applications to query via Scene API.

The haptic assets used in this project have been designed with [Haptics Studio](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/haptics-studio/), and were integrated using the [Haptics SDK for Unreal](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-haptics-sdk) following our [Haptic Design Guidelines](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/haptics-design-guidelines/).

   self-contained scene contains the introduction scene, showing the current
   mesh, and allows the player to start the game.
2. [TutorialScene.umap](./Content/Phanto/Maps/TutorialScene.umap): contains the
   tutorial for the player, presenting the controls and game dynamics.
3. [GameScene.umap](./Content/Phanto/Maps/GameScene.umap): this self-contained
   scene contains the assets for the actual gameplay. This includes Phanto, the
   Phantoms, and other assets.

# Health and safety guidelines

When building mixed reality experiences, we highly recommend evaluating your
content from a health and safety perspective to offer your users a comfortable
and safe experience. Please read the
[Mixed Reality H&S Guidelines](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/mr-health-safety-guideline/)
before designing and developing your app using this sample project, or any of
our Presence Platform features.

Developers should avoid improper occlusion, which occurs when virtual content
does not respect the physicality of the user’s environment. Improper Occlusion
can result in a misperception of actionable space.

- See
  [Occlusions with Virtual Content](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/mr-health-safety-guideline/#passthrough)

- To avoid improper occlusion, developers should ensure that users have (1)
  completed Space Setup and (2) granted Spatial Data permission (setup design)
  to allow proper occlusion in content placement, mesh collisions, and air
  navigation.

Using semi-transparent content lets the user have a better view of their
physical space and reduces the occlusion of objects or people that are not part
of the scanned mesh.

- Spatial data won’t incorporate dynamic elements of a user’s living space (for
  example, a chair that was moved after capture or a moving person/pet in the
  space).

- Uncaptured dynamic elements may be occluded by virtual content, making it more
  difficult for a user to safely avoid such hazards while engaged in the mixed
  reality experience.

# Design flow

The following diagrams represent the game's main user flow.

## Setup design

Prior to starting the game, the setup flow will verify the user has:

- Completed **Space Setup** and has a Scene Model
- Granted **Spatial Data** permission
  ([implementation instructions](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-spatial-data-perm/))

Without these two requirements, the application can't function. Therefore, the
user will only be able to advance to the next scene after complying with these
requirements.

```mermaid

graph TD;
    Lobby-->SpaceSetup;
    SpaceSetup-->Lobby;
    Lobby-->Permission;
    Permission-->Lobby;
```

When permission is denied, or if no Scene Model is present, the user will be
presented with prompts that allow them to rescan their room and grant
permissions.

|                      Missing scene prompt                       |                           Permission prompt                           |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |

## Gameplay design

The following diagram shows the high-level states for the player after they have
fulfilled the requirements above. When launching the game for the first time,
the player will go through a tutorial. Afterward, the tutorial can be skipped.

```mermaid
graph TD;

    Lobby-->Tutorial;
    Lobby-->Game;
    Tutorial-->Game;
    Game-->Win;
    Game-->Lose;

# Key components

The game demonstrates our recommended best practices when using the new scene
mesh feature and updated Scene API.

## The Scene Mesh

The scene mesh is provided in the project and is accessed using
**PhantoSceneActor**. Each one of the maps will create a
**PhantoSceneActor** and automatically load the mesh and room elements
captured during the space setup flow. The scene mesh will be represented as a
standard Unreal StaticMeshComponent and will respond to ray casts.

For more information on how to get started with scene mesh, visit
[Meta Quest Developer Portal](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/scene-best-practices/).

## The Ectofluid (Ghostly Goo)

The Ectofluid is a ghostly goo, created both by Phanto and their Phantoms.
Beware: once your room gets too covered with goo, you lose the game.

This element demonstrates the ability to place virtual content onto the physical
environment represented by the scene mesh. With this new ability, content can be
attached anywhere within the room reconstruction, adjusting itself to the real
physical environment.

## The Polterblast 3000

![Polterblast image](./Media/Hose.png 'Hose')

This element demonstrates the use of the scene mesh as a physics component. This
allows the fluid to collide with the mesh, and creates a splashing effect. We
recommend using particles with fast collisions to create a more immersive
experience.

- Use the Polterblast 3000 to throw Ectofluid and clean the ghostly goo from
  your room.
- Press the Right Trigger to throw Ectofluid

## Phanto and the Phantoms

![Phanto and Phantoms image](./Media/PhantoPhantoms.png 'Phanto and Phantoms')

Watchout! Some Phantoms are appearing in your room. Use the Polterblast 3000
(RT) and the Ecto Blaster (LT) to defeat all of them.

- Phanto is an air-navigated NPC that uses the scene mesh as a sensor to figure
  out available places, both to navigate to, and to spawn virtual elements onto
  (Ectofluid).
- The Phantoms are small, ground-navigated NPCs that use both the scene mesh and
  the room capture data (chairs, couch, desk, windows, etc.) to navigate across
  the environment, jump to targeted places, and spawn content (Ectofluid).

## Ecto Blaster

![Blaster image](./Media/Blaster.png 'Blaster')

The Ecto Blaster allows you to defeat the Phantoms. Place it in your room, and
it will target and throw Ectofluid at them. To place the Ecto Blaster, point to
any location in your room and press the Left Trigger. This element demonstrates
the ability to trace and ray cast against the environment, using the scene mesh
as a ray cast layer. This allows the user to create and place virtual content in
mixed reality that responds to the scene.

# Main scenes

## LobbyScene

This scene functions as an introductory scene for the player. The player can
view their scene, scan it, and change it. If no scene information is provided,
the player will be guided to the **Space Setup** flow. If there is scene
information for the current environment, the player can advance to one of these
three options:

1. [TutorialScene](#tutorialscene): starts the tutorial for the player.
2. [GameScene](#gamescene): starts the game for the player.
3. Trigger **Space Setup**: using the left trigger, the player can restart the
   **Space Setup** process, allowing them to rescan the environment in case
   something has changed.

| :----------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
| ![RescenScene](./Media/LobbyScene1.PNG 'Rescen Scene') | ![StartGame](./Media/LobbyScene2.PNG 'Start Game') |

## TutorialScene

The tutorial scene introduces the player to game mechanics. In this scene, the
player will learn how to:

- Use the Polterblast 3000.
- Place the Ecto Blaster.
- Shoot and interact with Phantoms.

When running the app for the first time, the tutorial is mandatory. Afterward,
the player will have the option to repeat the tutorial, or jump right into the
game.

In this scene, you can find examples of how some subcomponents (excluding
Phanto) are used in the game. In addition, a set of controller-locked UI screens
can be found here.

## GameScene

![Game Controls](./Media/GameControls.png 'Controls')

This scene includes prefabs for the main game components:

- Phanto
- Phantoms
- Polterblast 3000
- Ecto Blaster

You can use the scene in standalone mode and run it using Oculus Link, or by
building and deploying it to your device.

All the game components are present in this scene, and restarting the game is as
simple as reloading the scene. In addition, you can find debug features within
the scene, that can be enabled using the **Menu** button on the left controller.

Within the scene, you can find the **PhantoSceneActor** component, which takes
care of loading the mesh and scene information. Other components in the scene
are used to manage sound, GUI alerts, runtime assets, and game events.

## HapticsScene

Showcases the integration of haptics with dynamic modulation tied to controller interactions: Pressing the index or grab button will trigger a synchronized audio-haptic effect. Moving the thumbstick up or down will modulate the amplitude of the effect, while moving it left or right will modulate the frequency.

The haptic assets used in this project have been designed with [Haptics Studio](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/haptics-studio/), and were integrated using the [Haptics SDK for Unreal](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-haptics-sdk) following our [Haptic Design Guidelines](https://developer.oculus.com/resources/haptics-design-guidelines/).

To learn more about the Haptics SDK for Unreal, and how dynamically modulated haptics were implemented, check out the [BP_VRExamplePawn](https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unreal-Phanto/blob/main/Plugins/MetaXRHaptics/Content/Example/Blueprints/BP_VRExamplePawn.uasset) blueprint in the Haptics Scene, or the `Play random sound and haptic` function in the [BP_Phanto](https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unreal-Phanto/blob/main/Content/Phanto/Enemies/Phanto/BP_Phanto.uasset) blueprint for the Phanto haptics featured in the main game loop!

# Features illustrated

## Content Placement

![Content Placement](./Media/ContentPlacement.gif 'Content Placement')

The [BP_EctoBlasterSpawner](./Content/Phanto/EctoBlaster/BP_EctoBlasterSpawner.uasset) blueprint illustrates how to use the global mesh to place an object on the surfaces of the room.

## Mesh Collisions

![Mesh Collisions](./Media/MeshCollisions.gif 'Mesh Collisions')

The [EctoStream](./Content/Phanto/EctoFluid/EctoStream.uasset) particle system demonstrates using the global mesh for physics. Using fast collisions, the recommended way, the Ectofluid splashes off the mesh. It does this by using the Collision module in the Niagara particle system to bounce the particles off the surface of the global mesh.

## Air Navigation

![Air Navigation](./Media/AirNavigation.gif 'Air Navigation')

[BP_Phanto](./Content/Phanto/Enemies/Phanto/BP_Phanto.uasset) shows
how to use the scanned mesh as a sensor for an air navigated character (Phanto). See the `OnSphereOverlap` function in that blueprint for more info.

## Mesh Navigation

![Mesh Navigation](./Media/MeshNavigation.gif 'Mesh Navigation')

[GameScene](./Content/Phanto/Maps/GameScene.umap)'s Level Blueprint shows
how to use the mesh for ground navigation, with and without additional bounding
box information on the furniture (acquired using manual capture of the room
elements). You can see the NavMesh by running the console command `show Navigation` through the `~` terminal, or through [adb](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/developer-perspective-ue4-logging-and-console-commands-for-mobile-vr/) when on on device.

The scene's NavMesh is dynamically generated using the settings in [DefaultEngine.ini](./Config/DefaultEngine.ini) under `[/Script/NavigationSystem.RecastNavMesh]` and `[/Script/NavigationSystem.NavigationSystemV1]`.

Note that `bInitialBuildingLocked=True`. This allows GameScene to wait until the scene anchors have been spawned before creating the NavMesh, which is done when it calls `ReleaseInitialBuildingLock()`.

Once the NavMesh has been generated, GameScene also calls `SetNavigationRuntimeGenerationMode(Static)` and `ConfigureNavigationSystemAsStatic(true)`.

All of these functions are available in [PhantoBlueprintFunctionLibrary.h](./Source/Phanto/Public/PhantoBlueprintFunctionLibrary.h).

## Scene Visualization

![Scene Visualization](./Media/SceneVisualization.gif 'Scene Visualization')

The [LobbyScene](./Content/Phanto/Maps/LobbyScene.umap) presents the mesh and the furniture bounding box, if available.
