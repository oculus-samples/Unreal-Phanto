// Meta Haptics Native SDK
// =======================
//
// SDK initialization
// ------------------
//
// This header provides a C interface to the Meta Haptics Native SDK.
// The Haptics SDK has three backends, an OpenXR backend, an OVRPlugin backend and a callback backend.
//
//
// To initialize the Haptics SDK with the OpenXR backend, perform the following steps in order.
// Performing the initialization steps in the wrong order will most likely result in errors.
//
// 1. Set up logging by calling haptics_sdk_initialize_logging().
// 2. When you create the OpenXR instance with xrCreateInstance(), enable the optional extensions
//    that are supported by the OpenXR runtime.
//    If the optional extensions that are supported by the runtime are not enabled, the SDK may
//    fall back to lower-quality haptic playback and some features may not be available.
//   a. You can get the names of the optional extensions with
//      haptics_sdk_get_openxr_extension_count() and haptics_sdk_get_openxr_extension().
//   b. You can check which of those optional extensions are supported by the OpenXR runtime 
//      with xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties().
// 3. After creating the OpenXR instance, initialize the SDK and pass it the instance with
//    haptics_sdk_initialize_with_openxr().
// 4. After creating the OpenXR session, pass it to the SDK by calling
//    haptics_sdk_set_openxr_session().
// 5. When you set up your OpenXR actions, pass an action set to the SDK by calling
//    haptics_sdk_set_openxr_action_set(). The SDK will add a new action to it, which the SDK will
//    use as an output action for vibrations. You can either use a separate action set that is only
//    used by the SDK, or use the action set that also contains other application actions.
// 6. Bind the output action by including the SDKâ€™s suggested bindings in your call to
//    xrSuggestInteractionProfileBindings().
//   a. Use haptics_sdk_get_openxr_suggested_binding_count() and
//      haptics_sdk_get_openxr_suggested_binding() to get the suggested bindings.
// 7. Attach the action set to the OpenXR session with xrAttachSessionActionSets().
// 8. To save power when the system is idle, whenever the OpenXR session state changes,
//    call haptics_sdk_set_openxr_session_state() with the updated state.
//
// Playback operations will only be available when the OpenXR session's state is in the
// XR_SESSION_STATE_FOCUSED state.
//
//
// To initialize the Haptics SDK with the OVRPlugin backend, perform the following steps in order:
// 1. Set up logging by calling haptics_sdk_initialize_logging().
// 2. Initialize the SDK by calling haptics_sdk_initialize_with_ovr_plugin().
//
//
// To initialize the Haptics SDK with the callback backend, perform the following steps in order:
// 1. Define a callback function adhering to the signature provided by HapticsSdkPlayCallback.
//    The body of the callback function is intended to handle haptic playback data by forwarding
//    the playback data (duration, amplitude) to haptic play calls provided by your engine's or 
//    application's haptic playback API.
// 3. Initialize the SDK by calling haptics_sdk_initialize_with_callback_backend() with a pointer
//    to the callback function defined in the first step. 
//   a. You must ensure that the provided pointers are valid for the lifetime of the application
//      and are thread-safe.
//   b. If needed, also provide a context pointer. Otherwise, set the context pointer to a nullptr.
//
//
// When haptics are no longer required, SDK resources can be cleaned up by calling
// haptics_sdk_uninitialize().
//
//
// Thread Safety
// -------------
//
// All SDK functions can be called from any thread. If you call multiple functions from more than
// one thread at the same time, subsequent functions will block and wait until the first function
// has finished. This is because the SDK uses a global mutex internally.
//
//
// Errors
// ------
//
// Functions return a value from the HapticsSdkResult enum. The HAPTICS_SDK_SUCCEEDED and
// HAPTICS_SDK_FAILED macros are available for checking the result.
// When an error is encountered, call haptics_sdk_error_message() to retrieve an error message
// with information about what went wrong.
